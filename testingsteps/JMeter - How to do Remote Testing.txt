How to create Master Slave
Step 1 : SetUp Master

    For single machine 
          first check your ipaddress as same machine be master and slave
          run : ipconfig command to get address
          added remote systemâ€™s ip in jmeter.properties


Step 2 : create keystore file
    run create-rmi-keystore.bat / create-rmi-keystore.sh
   name : rmi
   password : changeit

Step 3 : run jmeter-server file on slave (remote) system

Step 4 : Run and Validate
    GUI and Commandline
  
tO RUN Remote machine from non gui mode

jmeter.bat -n -t "E:\Functions&VarDemoPlan.jmx" -l "E:\Functions&VarDemooutput.csv" -R 192.168.1.11

Helpful Tips:

all systems (master and slaves) have same ver of JMeter
all systems have java (preferably same ver)
all systems can connect to each other (are in same subnet)

no need to copy jmeter script (jmx) to slave systems

If you want to have 100 users and using  2 slaves. Give no as 50
