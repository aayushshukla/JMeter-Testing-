Timers:

Why we need timers:
   to pause thread for some time
   to add delay between threads
   to avoid over loading the server 
   to achieve real time behaviour by pacing the load 
  

wait 5sec 

user1 Req 1  -  5 sec

user2 Req  1  - 5sec

wait 10 sec

Req2   - 10 sec

REQ 2  - 10 SEC 


Constant timer
Uniform Random Timer 

 
Random Delay Max           by default it set 100
Constant Random Offset     by default it set 0

total delay in thread= 0.X *Random Delay Max + Constant delay offset

X: 0-9

0.X * 100 + 0  = 0-99
